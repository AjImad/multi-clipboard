# multi-clipboard

Python version 3.10.0

"This is my first  simple project with Python"

my project involve storing multiple data instead of traditional way that we all know (if you do ctrl+c you actually copy for example a word and if you do it again, your computer will ecrase the last copy and replace it by the new one). 

Let me make it simple for you ;)

So to launch the project:
NOTE : you have to be in the directory that include our project !
- In windows terminal write the following command: 
  python multiClipboard.py (save or load or list)
- in Mac OS terminal write the following command:
  python3 multiClipboard.py (save or load or list)

save : to save the word( that you copy it with ctrl+c) with specific key in json file.
load : to copy the data that you store it in json file with specific key that you chose for it.
list : to display all data stored in json file.
